- how to set up your web space as a DiS member.
- how to modify your layout.
- tips and general guidelines.

## Version 1 HTML editing: Template/ 

Web template written in HTML, CSS and PHP, by Anna Guinet.
Text editing is pure HTML. The code makes it possible to customize every element of the layout.

### Directory structure

- `template` contains the template.
- `template/css` contains the CSS style files.
- `template/img` contains the images loaded on your website.
- `template/slides` contains slides to link to on your website.


## Version 2 Markdown: Template-Markdown/

Adaptation of Version 1 with markdown by BenoÃ®t Viguier, without PHP.
This version makes it simpler to edit the text than pure HTML and is easier to read. 
But it makes more difficult to customize the layout. 

### Requirements

- `make` (optional)
- `python3`
- python3 extension: markdown
  > `pip3 install markdown`
- python3 extension: python-markdown-comment
  > `pip3 install python-markdown-comments`


### Directory structure

- `template-markdown` contains the template.
- `template-markdown/css` contains the CSS style files.
- `template-markdown/img` contains the images loaded on your website.
- `template-markdown/includes` contains the header and footer of the website.
- `template-markdown/md` containts markdown sources for the generated files.
- `template-markdown/slides` contains slides to link to on your website.

### Compilation of the website

Execute `make` or `python3 build.py` to generate the HTML files.

### Example

In order to process markdown in HTML tags, add `markdown="1"`. This latter attribute is removed when compiling.

```
<div markdown="1">
This markdown is processed. You only see the following list to edit:

- list item 1
- list item 2
</div>

<div>
### This will not be processed.
</div>
```
